# Descriptive_Statistics_and_Hypothesis_Testing

## About the Project

The Descriptive_Statistics_and_Hypothesis_Testing project is an educational tool aimed at learninf and practicing fundamental statistical concepts using Python 3. This project encompasses two main modules: Descriptive_Statistics.py and Hypothesis_Testing.py, each offering a variety of functions for performing statistical analysis. The project is particularly valuable for students and professionals looking to enhance their understanding of descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing methodologies.

## Technical Requirements
 
 - Python 3
 - Additional Python libraries as specified in requirements.txt

## Installation

 - Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
 - Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
 - In the project directory, execute "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the required Python libraries.

## Usage

 - Import the functions from the modules Descriptive_Statistics.py and Hypothesis_Testing.py in your Python environment.
 - Utilize the functions in these modules to perform various statistical analyses. Example usage includes:
 -- From Descriptive_Statistics.py, use functions like mean, std, minimum, and quantile for basic descriptive statistics.
 -- From Hypothesis_Testing.py, apply functions such as hypothesis_testing_single_sample or anova for conducting different hypothesis tests.

## Output

The primary output of this project includes:

 - Utilities for calculating and presenting descriptive statistics of datasets.
 - Functions for performing various hypothesis tests with outputs that include test statistics, critical values, and p-values.

These tools are instrumental in understanding and interpreting data, making them ideal for educational purposes in the field of statistics.
